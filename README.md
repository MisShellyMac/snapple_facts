# snapple_facts by Michelle McCarthy

## Project Baseline

- Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
- Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
- Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the __minimum viable project__ that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
- Create a repository on your personal Github account to house your project.

- Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:
  - What is the goal of the project?
  The goal of the project is to use an api(hopefully) to see if I can retrieve all snapple facts and present the results in a single page application.

  - Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)? Probably just myself, or snapple fact fiends, or people who do trivia and need random questions.

  - What are your personal learning goals?
  Originally it was to use an api to retrieve all the snapple facts but it doesn't look like one exists. However, I did find some sort of makeshift one that was on Github as an open source project which uses python script to kind of do what I wanted so I'm trying to see if I can use that and use the results to make my own CSV file.

  - What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  I will be using ruby on rails framework to build page. I would like to use some of the javascript we recently learned on the main page to see if I can make what's on the page a bit more animated or do something.

  - What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  I am working with trying to retrieve objects from a database, javascript, and just making sure my main page requires CSV.

  - What does success look like for this project? What does _done_ mean?
  Given the time constraints, I will be happy with being able to do random, and range and all snapple facts and having some kind of animation happen.

- Creat a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.
